# learning

This is the learning repo for the group. Since we're starting with the [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html), the aim is to provide an active arena for people to help each other clarify text, solutions to the exercises, and implementations of algorithms.

Initially, the aim is to provide a directory that maps to each chapter of the qiskit textbook, and contributors add their clarifications and solutions. The way the repo is organised or contributed to may change with community feedback.


## How to Contribute

There are a few main ways to contribute here, via pull requests:
1. Provide a solution to a qiskit textbook exercise.
2. Provide a clarification that you think is needed from the text.
3. Create an issue! If you need help understanding something or getting something working, the community may be able to help. If you find a particular thing confusing, chances are someone else does too.
4. Add general resources. Please be ready to justify the addition of links, since we don't want this to become a dumping-ground for anything loosely-connected with our aims.
5. Add a learning style. Everyone has their own style of learning, often contingent on their particular context. Adding yours can inspire people to try a new approach if they feel they aren't getting anywhere.
6. Make a suggestion. While it can't be guaranteed that the community will accept a given idea, it's usually worth putting it out there.

Anyone can contribute, at any time! However, in order to keep things from getting too messy, we ask that you follow these guidelines:

## Contribution style

The emphasis here is on _pedagogy_, with a mixture of code and text. As always, it will take some iterations to figure out what works best: A useful starting point is to submit entries as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Below are some ideas on how to make your content accessible:
 - Both direct descriptions and over-explained walkthroughs of a solution are useful.
 - Try to use a clean-code styleguide with appropriately-named variables ([PEP8](https://pep8.org/) is familiar to most Pythonistas).
 - Split circuits into smaller, appropriately-named subcomponents. The more parts one has to figure out the more difficult it is.
 - Simple-but-not-trivial, and general-case versions of provided code are often good teaching aids.
 - Importantly, please don't leave any sensitive information here (such as API keys, etc). There are various tools out there to help check, such as [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) and [high-entropy-string](https://github.com/lyft/high-entropy-string).
 - Try to either explain terms-of-art, or provide a link to a clear explanation. 

Mathematics can be added using [LaTex](https://towardsdatascience.com/write-markdown-latex-in-the-jupyter-notebook-10985edb91fd) - this works in both Markdown and Jupyter Notebook files. There are other useful resources for LaTex [here](https://davidhamann.de/2017/06/12/latex-cheat-sheet/) and [here](http://tug.ctan.org/info/latex-refsheet/LaTeX_RefSheet.pdf) If you'd prefer to add handwritten maths, one option is to import a small photo of your derivations into the Jupyter notebook.
